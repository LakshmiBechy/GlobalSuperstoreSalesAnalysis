# Global Super Store Sales Analysis
The project is designed to provide insights into the sales performance of the Global Superstore through interactive dashboards and visualizations. Here's a brief overview of the key features and insights offered by this project:

## Insights:

### Customer Wise Analysis:
The dashboard includes a line and stacked column chart to analyze the top 5 customers based on their orders and profits. This visualization allows to quickly identify the most valuable customers and understand their contribution to the store's profits.

### Product Wise Analysis:
Product analysis provides two key visualizations:
A clustered bar chart showcasing the top 5 profit-making and loss-making products. It enables to easily compare the performance of different products and identify areas of improvement.
A clustered column chart, illustrating the distribution of profits in different product sub-categories in comparison with sales.

### Shipping Analysis:
The shipping analysis is displayed using a Donut Chart, illustrating the percentage of shipping based on different ship modes. Additionally, a tooltip is provided to show shipping costs versus profits for each shipping mode, to understand the impact of shipping costs on profits.

### Geographical Breakdown of Sales:
The dashboard features a powerful decomposition tree visualization, providing a comprehensive geographical breakdown of sales based on Markets, Regions, States and Cities. It enables easy ranking of markets by sales and profit, highlights the top-performing region in each market, identifies the best-performing state within that region. Finally, the visualization drills down even further to reveal the top-performing city within the state and provides valuable information for targeted marketing efforts and localized strategies.

### Enhanced Data Exploration Options
In addition to above visualisations, the dashboard also offers various features to filter and focus on specific data subsets, for in-depth analysis.Here's an overview of the additional data filtration components:

#### Slicers: 
Various slicers have been incorporated into the dashboard, to easily narrow down the analysis by year, country, region, and market. Selecting specific values in these slicers helps to explore how sales and other metrics vary across different regions and time periods.

#### Tree Map: 
The tree map visualization enables to filter and study sales distribution and performance among three distinct customer segments - Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.
